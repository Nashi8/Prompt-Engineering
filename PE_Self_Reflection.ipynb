In 1956, the Dartmouth Conference marked the official birth of AI as a field, bringing together pioneers like John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky. Early AI programs focused on problem-solving and symbolic reasoning, but progress slowed during the “AI winters” of the 1970s and 1980s due to limited computing power and unmet expectations. The field was revitalized in the 2010s with the rise of machine learning and deep neural networks, fueled by large datasets and advances in graphics processing units (GPUs).

Unlike earlier periods of AI development, which were primarily academic, modern AI systems are integrated into products and services used by billions of people. Recommendation algorithms power platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Spotify, customizing content with remarkable precision. In healthcare, AI is used to detect diseases from medical images, assist in drug discovery, and personalize treatment plans. The financial sector relies on AI for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk management. Autonomous vehicles, once considered science fiction, are now being tested and deployed in several countries, guided by complex AI systems capable of interpreting and reacting to the environment in real time. Despite its rapid growth, AI also raises significant ethical concerns, including algorithmic bias, privacy issues, workforce displacement, and the challenge of creating regulation that keeps pace with innovation.
